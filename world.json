The dense, dark forest crowds in on all sides. Two well-trod foot paths intersect at the clearing, one leading through the forest north-south, the other east-west. The night sky is scattered with countles bright stars that twinkle, forming unknown constelations. The fire's warmth gives you comfort. Feel free to talk to the other travelers whom pass through while you are here.",
